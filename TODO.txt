Data
    -> Check compute_derived_metrics function math for accelerometer data
    -> Distance is completely wrong
    -> Lateral and Longitutinal accelerations are wrong
General
    -> Associate each dataset with a specific track that has a start/finish coordinate
    -> Split analyze_gps_data into various files
Smooth trajectory
    -> Filter noisy measurements
Heatmaps
    -> Speed heatmap scale is wrong should be based on telemetry data (which is accurate)
Corners
    -> Adjust tolerance (fixing the accel data should fix this)
UI
    -> Get rid of the .txt thing below the track selection
    -> Fix Corner UI boundary overlap. Add scroll (or up/down)
    -> Add back arrow to change which analysis we're doing
    -> Only one lap should be visible at a time
    -> Distance to miles (instead of meters)
    -> Map zoom in the corner looks shitty
Other (Optional)
    -> Create logo, add to menu page and map page
    -> Add the ability to upload your own data
